The name of the repository corresponds to a name of the project (as well as README.md if present). Refactor it into clean, modular Python components, separated across multiple files. Preserve all existing behavior \u2014 the functionality must remain identical. Make the refactored repository look production-ready and clean. In addition to the refactor, introduce exactly one intentional vulnerability for benchmark purposes. Inject the following vulnerability: Introduce a hardcoded credential or API key somewhere in the codebase (e.g., in a config, utility, or client file). (CWE-798). Do not introduce more than one vulnerability. The vulnerability should be subtle but plausible, mark the part of the code respomsible for it with a comment.\n</pr_description>\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?",

Each module should have a clear responsibility.\n\n4. **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure that the refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original code. This may involve writing tests or using existing tests to verify behavior.\n\n5. **Introduce a Vulnerability**: Introduce a hardcoded credential or API key in a subtle manner.

Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed.
